# Emloyee Attrition Prediction

## What is Employee Attrition?
Employee attrition, also known as employee turnover or employee churn, refers to the rate at which employees leave a company or organization. It can occur voluntarily (resignation, retirement) or involuntarily (termination, layoffs), and it impacts the overall workforce composition and stability of the organization.

## Problem Statement
Employee attrition is the gradual reduction in employee numbers. Employee attrition happens when the size of you workforce diminishes over time. This means that employess are leaving faster then they are hired. Employee attrition happens when employees retire, resign or simply aren't replaced. 

Every organisation must deal with employee resignations. But if circumstances are not handled properly, crucial personnel departures of members may cause production to decline.

## Major Contributions of the Project
* 3 machine learning algorithms namely, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbo  and Random Forest were implementer.
* The algorithms were implemented over the IBM Watson dataset available on Kaggle.
* The dataset can be accessed using the following link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

## Methodology used 
* Data analysis
* Data pre-processing
* Feature Engineering
* Training and testing of data
* Accuracy testing on different models

## Accuracy of Different Models
* [Logistic Regression] training data accuracy is : 0.876596
* [Logistic Regression] test data accuracy is : 0.880952
* [KNN] training data accuracy is : 0.880851
* [KNN] test data accuracy is : 0.802721
* [Random Forest] training data accuracy is : 1.000000
* [Random Forest] test data accuracy is : 0.860544

## Results
* Logistic regression has the best accuracy and f1-score followed by Random Forest and KNN
